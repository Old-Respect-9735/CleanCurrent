                            <p class ="text"><br>Generally, people don't know what's recyclable and what isn't. Even for adults, throwing waste away often results in human error. The average human produces around 6 pounds of trash and recycle per day. A large chunk of plastics with recyclable potential end up in the landfill and these landfills often leak into the ocean.  </p>

                            <p class ="text problemText"><br>These harmful plastics that end up in the ocean spread out due to ocean currents and pollute a variety of ecosystems. Studies have shown that around 100 million marine animals die from plastic waste every year with hundreds of thousands dying from entanglement. Marine biologists have also conducted several studies showing high levels of microplastics in canned tuna. These microplastics roaming through oceanic ecosystems and lifeforms have an effect on humans as well. Since coastal communities often rely on oceanic resources, trash and other pollution would damage the quality of life. This is where CleanCurrent comes in.
